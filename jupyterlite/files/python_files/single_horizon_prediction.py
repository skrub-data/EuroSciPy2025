# In particular, the input data keys for the full pipeline can be

# %%
hgbr_predictions.skb.get_data().keys()

# the steps of the DAG using the following (once uncommented):

#
# Since we passed input values to all the upstream `skrub` variables, `skrub`
# automatically evaluates the whole expression graph graph (train and predict
# on the same data) so that we can interactively check that everything will
# work as expected.
#
# ## Assessing the model performance via cross-validation
#
# Being able to fit the training data is not enough. We need to assess the
# ability of the training pipeline to learn a predictive model that can
# generalize to unseen data.
#
# Furthermore, we want to assess the uncertainty of this estimate of the
# generalization performance via time-based cross-validation, also known as
# backtesting.
#
# scikit-learn provides a `TimeSeriesSplit` splitter providing a convenient way to
# split temporal data: in the different folds, the training data always precedes the
# test data. It implies that the size of the training data is getting larger as the
# fold index increases. The scikit-learn utility allows to define a couple of
# parameters to control the size of the training and test data and as well as a gap
# between the training and test data to potentially avoid leakage if our model relies
# on lagged features.
#
# In the example below, we define that the training data should be at most 2 years
# worth of data and the test data should be 24 weeks long. We also define a gap of
# 1 week between the training.
#
# Let's check those statistics by iterating over the different folds provided by the
# splitter.

# Once the cross-validation strategy is defined, we pass it to the
# `cross_validate` function provided by `skrub` to compute the cross-validated
# scores. Here, we compute the mean absolute percentage error that is easily
# interpretable and customary for regression tasks with a strictly positive
# target variable such as electricity load forecasting.
#
# We can also look at the R2 score and the Poisson and Gamma deviance which are
# all strictly proper scoring rules for estimation of E[y|X]: in the large
# sample limit, minimizers of those metrics all identify the conditional
# expectation of the target variable given the features for strictly positive
# target variables. All those metrics follow the higher is better convention,
# 1.0 is the maximum reachable score and 0.0 is the score of a model that
# predicts the mean of the target variable for all observations, irrespective
# of the features.
#
# No that in general, a deviance score of 1.0 is not reachable since it
# corresponds to a model that always predicts the target value exactly
# for all observations. In practice, because there is always a fraction of the
# variability in the target variable that is not explained by the information
# available to construct the features.

# Those results show very good performance of the model: less than 3% of mean

#
# We observe a bit of variability in the scores across the different folds: in

# other folds. This is likely due to the fact that the first fold contains
# training data from 2021 and 2022 and the test data mostly from 2023.

# The invasion in Ukraine and a sharp drop in nuclear electricity production

# model that would provide the an output identical to the observed values. Thus, the
# ranking of such hypothetical model is the best possible ranking. However, you should
# note that the oracle model is not the line passing through the right-hand corner of
# the plot. Instead, this curvature is defined by the distribution of the observations.
# Indeed, more the observations are composed of small values and a couple of large
# values, the more the oracle model is closer to the right-hand corner of the plot.
#
# A true model is navigating between the diagonal and the oracle model. The area between
# the diagonal and the Lorenz curve of a model is called the Gini index.
#
# For our model, we observe that each oracle model is not far from the diagonal. It
# means that the observed values do not contain a couple of large values with high
# variability. Therefore, it informs us that the complexity of our problem at hand is
# not too high. Looking at the Lorenz curve of each model, we observe that it is quite
# close to the oracle model. Therefore, the gradient boosting regressor is
# discriminative for our task.
#
# Then, we have a look at the reliability diagram. This diagram shows on the x-axis the
# mean predicted load and on the y-axis the mean observed load.

# ### Exercise: non-linear feature engineering coupled with linear predictive model
#
# Now, it is your turn to make a predictive model. Towards this end, we request you
# to preprocess the input features with non-linear feature engineering:
#
# - the first step is to impute the missing values using a `SimpleImputer`. Make sure
#   to include the indicator of missing values in the feature set (i.e. look at the
#   `add_indicator` parameter);
# - use a `SplineTransformer` to create non-linear features. Use the default parameters
#   but make sure to set `sparse_output=True` since it subsequent processing will be
#   faster and more memory efficient with such data structure;
# - use a `VarianceThreshold` to remove features with potential constant features;
# - use a `SelectKBest` to select the most informative features. Set `k` to be chosen
#   from a log-uniform distribution between 100 and 1,000 (i.e. use `skrub.choose_int`);
# - use a `Nystroem` to approximate an RBF kernel. Set `n_components` to be chosen
#   from a log-uniform distribution between 10 and 200 (i.e. use `skrub.choose_int`).
# - finally, use a `Ridge` as the final predictive model. Set `alpha` to be
#   chosen from a log-uniform distribution between 1e-6 and 1e3 (i.e. use
#   `skrub.choose_float`).
#
# Use a scikit-learn `Pipeline` using `make_pipeline` to chain the steps together.
#
# Once the predictive model is defined, apply it on the `feature_with_dropped_cols`
# expression. Do not forget to define that `target` is the `y` variable.
