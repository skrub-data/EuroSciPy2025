    "  to include the indicator of missing values in the feature set (i.e. look at the\n",
    "  `add_indicator` parameter);\n",
    "- use a `SplineTransformer` to create non-linear features. Use the default parameters\n",
    "  but make sure to set `sparse_output=True` since it subsequent processing will be\n",
    "  faster and more memory efficient with such data structure;\n",
    "- use a `VarianceThreshold` to remove features with potential constant features;\n",
    "- use a `SelectKBest` to select the most informative features. Set `k` to be chosen\n",
    "  from a log-uniform distribution between 100 and 1,000 (i.e. use `skrub.choose_int`);\n",
    "- use a `Nystroem` to approximate an RBF kernel. Set `n_components` to be chosen\n",
    "  from a log-uniform distribution between 10 and 200 (i.e. use `skrub.choose_int`).\n",
    "- finally, use a `Ridge` as the final predictive model. Set `alpha` to be\n",
    "  chosen from a log-uniform distribution between 1e-6 and 1e3 (i.e. use\n",
    "  `skrub.choose_float`).\n",
    "\n",
