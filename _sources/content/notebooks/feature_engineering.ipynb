    "# Feature engineering for electricity load forecasting\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to use `skrub` and\n",
    "`polars` to perform feature engineering for electricity load forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a set of features (and targets) from different data sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical weather data for 10 medium to large urban areas in France;\n",
    "- Holidays and standard calendar features for France;\n",
    "- Historical electricity load data for the whole of France.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these data sources cover a time range from March 23, 2021 to May 31,\n",
    "2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our maximum forecasting horizon is 24 hours, we consider that the\n",
    "future weather data is known at a chosen prediction time. Similarly, the\n",
    "holidays and calendar features are known at prediction time for any point in\n",
    "the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, exogenous features derived from the weather and calendar data can\n",
    "be used to engineer \"future covariates\". Since the load data is our\n",
    "prediction target, we will can also use it to engineer \"past covariates\" such\n",
    "as lagged features and rolling aggregations. The future values of the load\n",
    "data (with respect to the prediction time) are used as targets for the\n",
    "forecasting model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to install some extra dependencies for this notebook if needed (when\n",
    "running jupyterlite). We need the development version of skrub to be able to\n",
